"# ajax" 



In this video tutorial I am going to show you how the AJAX works between client ( browser) side and Server side 
and how data 
is being passed among them.
Ajax Full meaning is Asynchronus JavaScript and XML.

Asyncronus JavaScript and XML
===============================
Asyncronus - Asynchronus we know no dependency and multiple task could be perfoemed at the same time.
XML        - Data is XML - Extended Markup Language with the starting tag <xml>
              this xml could be plain text,orginal xml format or JSON format according to need we will use.
Javascript - Code is in javascript


What happen in Traditional way.
=============================
we submit data from browser and we wait until data recived from the server again and full loaded to the browser.
This is the drawback to work multiple task and is not fancy and we need to wait for server 
response and page being loaded again.

Ajax resolve this problem
===========================
we dont need to wait for server response 
with ajax browser is like desktop to play with.
we can do other task on browser when ajax work on back end by api and 
at the same time we can send multiple request to the server.
we can send request to the server asyncronously or syncronously.
when ayncrhonus no dependancy among the request sent.
when synchronus browser wait until previous task has been performed.

Sate of Task Perfoemed
=========================
ready state
open state
send 
wait and call back
