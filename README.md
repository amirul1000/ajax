Ajax ( Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) with PHP MySQL API
==========================================================

I am going to show you how the AJAX works between client  side and Server side 
and how the data 
is being passed among them.
Ajax Full meaning is Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
==================================
Asynchronous - Asynchronous we know no dependency and multiple tasks could be performed at the same time.

XML        - Data is XML(Extended Markup Language) with the starting tag XML.This XML  could be plain text,original XML format or JSON format according to need we will use.

JavaScript - Code is in JavaScript

What happens in Traditional way.
=========================================
we submit data from browser and we wait until data received from the server again and full loaded to the browser.
This is the drawback to work multiple task and is not fancy and we need to wait for server 
response and the page being loaded again.

Ajax resolves this problem
=============================================
we don't need to wait for server response 
with ajax browser is like desktop to play with.
we can do other tasks on the browser when ajax works 
with back end by API and 
at the same time we can send multiple requests to the server.
we can send request to the server asynchronously or synchronously.
when asynchronous no dependency among the request sent.
when synchronous browser wait until previous task has been performed.

States of Task Performed
========================================
ready state
open state
send 
wait and call back
